A browser extension (code by Google Gemini) that implements the base conversion methods from [Alternative Algorithms for Base Conversion (Steve Palmer, 2007, unpublished)](https://github.com/remlaps/PascalTriangleBaseConversions/blob/master/AlternateBaseConversionAlgorithms.pdf).  These use matrix multiplication to perform vector-oriented base conversions when one base is a multiple of another or using the offset between bases.
